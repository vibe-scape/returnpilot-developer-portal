### Overview

The ReturnPilot API uses a variety of formats and conventions to ensure consistency across its endpoints.

This guide provides an overview of the formats you can expect to encounter when working with the API.

### Timestamps

All timestamps returned by the API follow the given format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
